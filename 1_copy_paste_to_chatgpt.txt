You need to do the tasks described below.

Use the following information to find what input and what output the code should produce —
You will take input of a pdf of a research paper which i am uploading in the chat.
The research paper will contain some stress strain graphs. I am also uploading the images from the pdf which are stress strain graphs.

Also, when the code is executing make sure to add a message to the console so that I know at what stage of execution the program is currently in.

Algorithm starts---

Process - 
You will take the pdf file and the images of the stress strain graphs I will upload in the chat.
You will then need to populate the sections marked below as {populate} based on the information you have from the pdf and the images.

Note - The pdf I am giving you will basically be having a corresponding JSON as described below.


JSON you need to populate. The JSON file looks like this but not exactly since multiple graphs and multiple curves in a graph are possible ---

    }
  ]
}

What is output for this step ? - The JSON file should be outputted.
